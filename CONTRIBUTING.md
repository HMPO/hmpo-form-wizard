## Contributing code

### Indentation and whitespace

Your JavaScript code should pass linting checks.

We use ESLint with its rules defined by [eslint.config.js](eslint.config.js)
Some useful docs on ESLint can be found here:
* [ESLint - Getting Started](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started)
* [ESLint - CLI Options](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface)
* [ESLint for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint#:~:text=If%20you%20haven't%20installed,create%20an%20.eslintrc%20configuration%20file.)

We ask that you maintain 4-space, soft-tabs only indentation.

### Testing

Please ensure unit tests are added or updated as appropriate for your changes.

### Commit hygiene

To keep our commit history clean and easy to follow, we kindly ask that you squash your commits before merging your branch into the main branch. This helps to consolidate changes and makes the history more readable.
